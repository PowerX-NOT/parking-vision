## Implementation Notes

1. **YOLOv5 Integration**: The code assumes you have YOLOv11 properly set up. You may need to:
   - Clone the YOLOv11 repository
   - Install its specific requirements
   - Place your trained model weights in the models folder

2. **Performance Optimization**: For real-time applications, consider:
   - Implementing frame skipping for video processing
   - Using GPU acceleration
   - Optimizing the image preprocessing pipeline

3. **Advanced Features to Add**:
   - Perspective transformation for angled camera views
   - Temporal consistency checks for video
   - Database integration for storing occupancy data
   - Web interface for remote monitoring

4. **Testing**: Create sample scripts in the `notebooks/` directory to test individual components before integrating them into the main pipeline.

This implementation provides a complete pipeline from input processing to visualization, with flexibility to switch between different detection and classification methods through the configuration file.
